    "When desinging and training a neural network for a given task, what is usually done is that its learnable parameters are gradually tuned according to a loss function until it reaches an acceptable level of performance. This already supposes that you have a good enough understanding of the task to be able to design a suitable loss function. But after training your network for hundreds of thousands of iterations, what can you tell about its reasoning? Can we learn anything about the algorithms it has learned through its parameters? Very often, the answer is no! Most neural networks are considered \"black boxes\", that is, models that take inputs and return solutions without you having the slightest idea how the solution was created. Indeed, if we look \"inside\" a network, all we will find are tensors of numbers, without any meaning for us humans whatsoever. In fact, not much can be done about explainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "But then, how can we be sure that our model actually solves the task it has been created for and not another one that is close? How can we trust our model to provide us with a correct solution at all times? In fact, some of the tasks that we want to solve are so hard to properly describe and to formalize that [proxy values](https://centerforgov.gitbooks.io/benchmarking/content/Proxy.html) are sometimes used. A proxy value is a quantity that is strongly linked to the task you want to solve. If selected correctly, solving for the proxy calue will give you a good solution for your initial problem. The issue is, a neural network could learn its own proxy values during its training without us noticing it! For example, if your dataset is biased (over- or under-representation of some of the classes), your model could learn an easier proxy value to solve for the most represented class in your dataset, while having abysmal performances on the rest.\n",
