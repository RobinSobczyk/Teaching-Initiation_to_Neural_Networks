# <p style="color:red">Neural Networks : The basics made for all</p>
By Bastien Lhopitallier and Robin Sobczyk

In this course, you will learn :
- what is an artificial neuron and how it is linked to biological neurons
- what is a neural network
- how training is done for neural network, and what are the different options for training
- the main different types of neural networks
- how to code a neural network from scratch
- how to code your first neural network with PyTorch and train it
- how to create and read a computation flow of a neural network
- how to debug your neural network through gradient inspection
- what are the risks of neural networks with malicious sample optimisation
- how to run basic analysis of the activations with heatmaps
- what are the limits of neural networks with some measures of random effects

Idées en vrac :
- Représentation diverses (CNN)
- Front and back flow
- JAX/torch.func
- Automatic diff
- Overfitting, underfitting
- faire une boucle d'entrainement
- savoir identifier l'overfitting

À faire :
- [ ] faire un vrai sommaire avec un vrai découpage
- [ ] détailler chaque point du sommaire
- [ ] mettre une licence
- [ ] regarder comment share (gitfront.io ?)
- [ ] ajouter un `requirements.txt`
